Problem : Suppose you have some data on which you want to do left or right padding. 
But couchbase doesn't provide any inbuilt function for that.

Sample Bucket :
"products" :
{
"type" : "products",
"id" : "123455677",
"name" : "ABC",
"ean" : "5012345678"
}

Here we want to have ean with leading zero's and of length 12 from database itself.


Solution :

Left Padding : REPEAT('0', (12 - LENGTH(products.ean)))|| '' ||products.ean)

Query:

SELECT REPEAT('0', (12 - LENGTH(products.ean)))|| '' ||products.ean) AS EAN 
FROM `products-sample` AS products
WHERE LENGTH(products.ean) < 12 
AND products.type = 'products'

Similary, you can have right padding on any column.

Right Padding : products.ean || '' ||REPEAT('0', (12 - LENGTH(products.ean)))
